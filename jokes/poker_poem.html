<h1>Where is the Poker God?</h1>

<p>O Poker God, Poker God,<br>
Why have you wronged me so? <br>
My chip count has reached an all time low.</p>

<p>All I want to do is see a flop,<br>
But I ended up working in McDonald's, with a mop.</p>

<p>I even lost a game where I had pocket aces,<br>
I got so pissed off, I punched a kid with braces. </p>

<p>This game makes me so mad, it brings my piss to a boil,<br>
This game makes me so scared, it gets my pants soiled.</p>

<p>O Poker God, Poker God,<br>
What happened to all my luck?<br>
This game is just a big shitload of _____!</p>

<p>Why is it that I am so addicted to gambling?<br>
Maybe that's why you're listening to me rambling.</p>

<p>I wanna quit and save my money and buy other things.<br>
But there's no joy like at the end-game when I'm counting my winnings.</p>

<p>O Poker God, Poker God,<br>
I keep losing to others, why can't I catch a break?<br>
Bluffing is an art, just like cooking a well-done steak.</p> 

<p>I just want to win a hand here and there.<br>
But this shitty game is just not fair!</p>
